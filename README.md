UNICEF internal open source handbook
====================================

[![License: CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by-legal]

A fork of [Microsoft's OSPO courses](https://github.com/microsoft/OSPO-Courses) to shape an early open source community at UNICEF Office of Global Innovation.
_The content in this repository is in a research phase and does not include any official recommendations or policies_.


## :information_source: Format and Structure

This repository contains a number of courses that Microsoft uses internally to drive knowledge and culture around open source.
These are being forked and modified into a UNICEF Innovation context.

- Each course is broken into modules, and chapters, prefixed by a number to reflect order.
- Files are written in markdown to be simplest for transferring to other learning systems.
  Microsoft used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Course in a Box](https://course-in-a-box.p2pu.org/#:~:text=P2PU%20created%20Course-in-a-Box%20in%202014%20as%20a%20free,and%20we%20welcome%20contributions%20on%20our%20Github%20repo.) to present modular content using GitHub Pages.
  These are also easy to cut and paste into Moodle and other Learning Management Systems.
- We have replaced Microsoft brand images with those licensed through [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).
